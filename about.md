## Bio

Howdy, as you might know, my name's Lucas da Silva, a self-taught, dedicated and highly motivated Front End Developer with seven years of experience in Web application development with the focus on Web performance and accessibility.

Recently I've been playing with mobile apps, both iOS and Android using React Native in my current job at [Garage Born](https://www.garageborn.com/), where we are building [mttrs](https://mtt.rs), a news aggregator app/website.
