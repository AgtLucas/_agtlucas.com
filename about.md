Hi! I’m **Lucas da Silva**, a <s>Software Developer</s> Technical Writer from Brazil living in the south of Brazil after spending almost two years in Berlin. <s>I love The Web and besides the fact I have a little crush into native mobile applications, I consider myself a Front-End developer in my heart.</s> I'm not sure if I love The Web anymore... maybe I still do, but simple times are over, and The Web now is super complicated.

I really enjoy helping others and build communities. I was the creator of GDG Jaraguá do Sul, back in 2014, I helped as volunteer in 5 React conferences (ReactEurope 2016 - Paris, ReactLondon - London, React Native EU - Wroclaw, React Day Berlin - Berlin, React Amsterdam - Amsterdam).

Nowadays my main focus is all about <s>creating accessible user interfaces for both The Web and iOS platform</s> writing good documentation and exploring my creative side.
