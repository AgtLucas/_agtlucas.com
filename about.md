## \$ ~ whoami

Hi! I’m **Lucas da Silva**, a Software Developer from Brazil living in the south of Brazil after spending almost two years in Berlin. I love The Web and besides the fact I have a little crush into native mobile applications, I consider myself a Front-End developer in my heart.

I really enjoy helping others and build communities. I was the creator of GDG Jaraguá do Sul, back in 2014, I helped as volunteer in 5 React conferences (ReactEurope 2016 - Paris, ReactLondon - London, React Native EU - Wroclaw, React Day Berlin - Berlin, React Amsterdam - Amsterdam).

Nowadays my main focus is all about creating accessible user interfaces for both The Web and iOS platform.

You can find my résumé [here](/resume.pdf).
