## Bio

Howdy, as you might know, my name's **Lucas da Silva** (people call me **AgtLucas**, sometimes), a self-taught, dedicated and highly motivated Front End Developer with seven years of experience in Web application development with the focus on Web performance and accessibility.

I've been playing with mobile apps, both iOS and Android using React Native  since my last job at [Garage Born](https://www.garageborn.com/), where I helped them build "[Matters](https://mtt.rs)", a news aggregator app/website.

Currently I'm working as a Front End Developer at [HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com).
