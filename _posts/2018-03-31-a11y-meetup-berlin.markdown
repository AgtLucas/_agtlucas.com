Last day 20th of March I had the opportunity to give a talk on Web Accessibility Principles at the [A11y Meetup Berlin](https://a11y-meetup-berlin.de/). The experience to share what we know, even small things is priceless, even more about an underrated topic such as Accessibility.

The goal of my talk was to introduce the four principles of Web Accessibility, show how we may break them and instigate key questions we can ask ourselves in order to build inclusive products.

You can check the slides [here in this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h36YipgkSGxNsXC63PP4qFQGwqB9I4tt_a5cjvVSfWk/edit#slide=id.g3501b48938_0_3), and watch the video below. :)
